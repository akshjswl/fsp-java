 ###	data types in java

A data type defines the types of data which can be shown in a computer memory. A data type also specifies how much ammount of memory space a particular variable allocates in the memory

1. primitive data type
2. non-primitive data type

primitive data type

1. Boolean- Boolean(1bit)
2. character- char(2bytes)
3. integer-byte(1 byte), short(2 bytes), Int(4 byte), Long (8 bytes)
4. floating - Float(4 bytes), double(8 bytes)

 non-primitive data type
1. string 
2. array
3. class 
4. interface



### Polymorphosim

## method overloading
In java it is posssible to have multiple method within the same class, with the same name as long as they differ in their argument list. 
this mechanism is called method overloading and the method are called as overloaded methods.
Using method overloading java supports the concept of Polymorphosim.


## constructor overloading
In java it is possible to have multiple constructor within a class as long as they differin their number or types of arguments. This mechanism is called constructor overloading and the constructors are called overloaded constructors. 


using constructor overloading we can initailize diffrent object of thew same class with diffrent values


## nested class in java

in java it is possible to have one class inside another class. this is known nesting of classes 
it has two types:
1. static nested class
2. non-static nested class

static nested class: A static nested class can directly access the static variables of its outer class. It can not directly access the non static members of its outer class 

// wap to display use of static nested class
